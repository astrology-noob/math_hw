1. Cramer's Rule
A rule in linear algebra used to solve systems of linear equations. Program gets the main-matrix-of-the-system values as well as given constant values and calculates roots of the system using determinants of the matrices.

2. Bisection Method
A method used to solve non-linear equations. Calculates one root contained in a given section by finding the middle argument value between the two border argument values continuously until the accuracy of division-value corresponds to pre-defined epsilon-accuracy.
